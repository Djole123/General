Things to note:
My SQL files are in 2 seperate files, instea of datamodel.sql I have markers.sql and users.sql.
I have named the files differently than required and I didn't notice they had to be named a certain way until I finished the task.
To avoid confusing the files and what links them together I decided to keep it the same and just provide a legend.
Here is the legend as follows:
Sample -> results_sample
MapPage -> individual_sample
AddSighting -> submission
SignUp -> registration
Search -> search (obviously)

Secondly, I have removed the search bar from the navigational menu when on the advanced search page on purpose.
At first this may seem like a mistake but it was fully intentional.
Having that on the search page felt redundant.
